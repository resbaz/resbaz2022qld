  description: "Although R programming has been a part of research since its origins in the 1990s, few research studies have addressed scientific software development from a Software Engineering (SE) perspective. The past few years have seen unparalleled growth in the R community, and it is time to push the boundaries of SE research and R programming forwards. </br></br>This talk will summarise the findings of SE research at the intersection with technical debt, when applied to R programming. We will discuss testing debt, documentation debt, self-admitted technical debt, and avoidance of CRAN checks. Additionally, it will propose a set of good practices derived from those findings aiming to act as a call-to-arms for both the R and RSE (Research SE) community to explore specific, interdisciplinary paths of research.

  description: "Ever wanted to share your R code with industry partners or end users who weren’t familiar with the language? Or wished that you could build an interactive app that only required non-technical stakeholders to click a few buttons? <br><br> Shiny is a popular R package that allows you to build highly interactive web applications—without needing any other programming languages. Using Shiny you can share your analyses as dashboards and visualisations and create interactive platforms for anybody to use the tools you create (see examples here https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/). <br><br>This is a workshop aimed at anyone with a working knowledge of R who is interested in better communicating their results with non-technical stakeholders. In the first part of this workshop, you will be introduced to the basic syntax and principles of R Shiny. Then we will develop an app that allows users to upload data, run analyses, and display the results in a figure and/or a map."

  description: "EcoCommons is building the platform of choice to analyse and model ecological and environmental problems while also increasing digital literacy of researchers and students. This workshop will focus on improving your computational skills by showing you how the statistical program R can be used for data analysis and visualisation in Ecology.  <br><br>The course starts with some basic information about the R syntax, the RStudio interface, and moves through how to import CSV files. We will also show you the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors and how to add/remove rows and columns. By the end of the workshop participants will have an overview of how to run their R code in the EcoCommons cloud environment and how to use the R package {tidyverse} to manipulate and visualise their data. In particular, we will demonstrate how to use the functions ‘select’ and ‘filter’ to manipulate your data and how to use the ‘pipe operator’ for more complex data manipulation in combination with ‘summarise’, ‘group_by’ and ‘count’ for quick summary statistics. At the end, we will show you how to visualise your data using different plots in the R package {ggplot2}. <br><br>This workshop is suitable for early career researchers, undergraduates and ecologists who have a keen interest to learn how to code in R while harnessing the power of cloud computing to solve environmental challenges. This course is very suitable for researchers, students and practitioners who have no or little R experience and coding skills and have the desire to learn how to use code within the cloud-computing resources of EcoCommons. It is also well suited for people who would like to refresh their coding skills in R. <br><br>This workshop is based on the Carperntries course: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/  <br><br>This workshop is brought to you by EcoCommons Australia. EcoCommons is a partnership of nine organisations including the NCRIS-funded Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), CEBRA at the University of Melbourne, CSIRO’s Land and Water unit, Griffith University, Macquarie University, QCIF, TERN, and the University of NSW. It also involves investment from the Queensland Government’s Research Infrastructure Co-investment Fund (RICF). <br><br><br>No prior knowledge needed <br><br>It is essential that you install and test R and RStudio well before the workshop. <br><br>Please carefully follow the instructions on https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html to download, install and configure R and RStudio on your computer.

  description: "In this workshop, you will learn how to properly document and organise your functions to create an R package. Creating an R package is beneficial both when it comes to sharing code with other people, but also for home use. It makes it easier to call up your repertoire of functions and provides you with help files so that it is easy for you to remember how to use your functions long after you have built them. While the main purpose of this workshop is to construct an R package, I will also demonstrate how to use git to 'save' different versions of your package, as well as how to push your package onto GitHub so that it can be accessible to other people. <br><br><br>Prerequisites/prior knowledge needed: Enough knowledge of the R programming language to build a function. Students do not need to be proficient. <br><br>Laptops/software installation needed: Participants should bring a laptop, with R and RStudio installed. Having git installed and a GitHub account is beneficial, but not necessary. Having some existing R functions ready that the participant would like to turn into a function is encouraged, however I will provide some dummy functions for participants to work on if they do not bring their own."
